# Web Guesser

## Description

This is a web guesser, a web app which allows a user to guess a number between 0 and 99 (inclusive), to see if he matches the
number randomically generated by the computer. The user has 5 guesses to make; after each guess, he receives feedback from 
the app, saying if the guess was too low/high (or way too low/high, when he misses the target by more than 5 units) and the 
background color of the page changes accordingly. 

After 5 wrong guesses or after a correct guess, the game is restarted with a new random number to be guessed. If the user adds 
"&cheat=true" to the URL, he is able to see the secret number.

## How to run the app

To run this app in your local computer, you need to install Sinatra and its reloader gem (to avoid the need to restart the local 
server when a change is made to the files). Type the following commands on terminal.

```
$ gem install sinatra
$ gem install sinatra-contrib
```

Then, change to the project directory, start the server (``` $ ruby web_guesser.rb ```) and go to http://localhost:4567 in your browser.
